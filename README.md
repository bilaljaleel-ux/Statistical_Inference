# Statistical_Inference
Statistical inference using Python, covering sampling distributions, Central Limit Theorem, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, and bootstrapping.
# Statistical Inference

This project demonstrates core statistical inference concepts using Python.

## Topics Covered
- Simple Random Sampling
- Point Estimation
- Sampling Distributions
- Central Limit Theorem
- Standard Error
- Confidence Intervals (t-distribution)
- Hypothesis Testing (One-sample t-test)
- Bootstrapping

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib

## Key Learning Outcome
This notebook shows how uncertainty in estimates is quantified and how
statistical inference is performed using both theoretical and computational
methods.
